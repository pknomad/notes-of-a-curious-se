# Site Reliability Engineering; Targeting Reliability

## Agenda
1. Operating for Reliability
2. Choosing a Good SLI
3. Developing SLOs and SLIs
4. Quantifying Risks to SLOs
5. Consequences of SLO Misses


## DevOps vs SRE
1. Reduce Organization Silos
2. Accept Failure as Normal
3. Implement Gradual Change
4. Leverage Tooling & Automation
5. Measure Everything

SREs use Devops metholdology.
1. Share ownership
2. SLOs & blameless PMs
3. Reduce cost of failure
4. Automate this year's job away
5. Measure toil and reliability

"class SRE implements DevOps"

    software = 99.9%
    operations = 99.99%
    business = 99.999%
