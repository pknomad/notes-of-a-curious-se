# Notes of a curious Systems Engineer

My first job at Pilot Fiber provided an illuminating experience that I wouldn't trade for the world.
Although the company had its imperfections, I was able to connect with an amazing mentor (*Hey Luis!*) and introduced me to the fascinating world of technology and startups.

Working in a startup can often be like drinking out of a water hose. As a first dedicated IT hire, I needed to deploy a new MDM, establish policies, and provide level of services most established companies take for granted.
I frequently tackled on these challenges by working harder, and not necessarily smarter. Eventually growing requirements demanded more hours and eventually I found myself short of my expectations. When the [High Sierra password bug](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/11/macos-bug-lets-you-log-in-as-admin-with-no-password-required/) became publicly known, I took it upon myself to manually update all the computers with the security patch overnight.

I left that night (*4 AM!*) feeling super exhausted, but also with a resolve that I wouldn't have myself repeat the same experience.

As a rookie, I wondered: "How can I avoid this problem in the future?" As luck would have it - I ran across a book called [Site Reliability Engineering: How Google Runs Production Systems](https://sre.google/sre-book/table-of-contents/) at a local bookstore. Curiosity took over; I finished the book on the same day.

The author boldly states in the introduction:
>SRE is fundamentally doing work that has historically been done by an operations team, but using engineers with software expertise, and banking on the fact that these *engineers are inherently both predisposed to, and have the ability to, design and implement automation with software to replace human labor.*

I knew since that moment that I would like to work in such a role: automate the daily toil while tackling challenging problems that are intellectually rewarding. I made it a goal to learn something new that would help me automate my job away but also help me get closer to working for a team that values the tenets of Site Reliability Engineering.

These notes will contain the things I've learned (often skills demanded for the role of an SRE) and my hope is that it will help others finding themselves in similar shoes. Hopefully tacking this in git will keep me honest about recording the work I've done.
